"""US (NYSE) full-market-closure holiday calendar, computed from the standard
observance rules rather than a hardcoded per-year list -- good enough for a personal
sync gate, not a substitute for an official trading calendar. Known gap: early-close
half-days (e.g. the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve some years) aren't modeled
as reduced hours -- the worst case there is a couple of wasted after-hours sync
attempts, never a missed sync during the actual open session.
